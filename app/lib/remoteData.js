            Having performed on countless albums across four decades - Michael Landau is undoubtedly one of the most recorded guitarists of all time. An L.A. session ace and a player's player, Landau's soulful, dynamic and endlessly creative playing has allowed him to remain in-demand across eras and genres, firmly establishing his legacy as an icon of the electric guitar. Mike's guitar has graced records by Pink Floyd, James Taylor, Joni Mitchell, Michael Jackson, B.B. King, Rod Stewart, Mile Davis, Boz Scaggs, Tim McGraw, Bonnie Raitt and many more. Throughout his career, Michael's constant companion, workhorse, canvas and muse has been a 1959 Stratocaster® affectionately called "Coma." Michael found the Coma at a local L.A. guitar shop when he was 16. The refinished body and swapped-out pickups gave him all the permission he needed to customize the instrument throughout his career to match his evolving style. The distinctive Coma Red finish and permanent marker "Coma" graphic make it unmistakable, and the guitar has had several different incarnations over the years, hosting a wide variety of pickups, electronics, hardware configurations and bridges.
            
            The version of Coma recreated in the Fender® Stories collection represents the guitar as it exists now. Electronics include custom-designed ML Ultra Noiseless Strat® neck-and-middle pickups and a custom Wide Range humbucking pickup in the bridge position. Hardware includes a 6-screw vintage-style Stratocaster tremolo with a cold-rolled steel block, a custom ML-spec neck, Fender ClassicGear™ tuning machines and the signature faded red satin lacquer body complete with a Floyd Rose® route. The Michael Landau Coma Stratocaster wears its rich history on full display, truly representing a vital artist that's always in transition. Included in the custom Coma-embroidered hardshell case are a "Coma" sticker set, custom strap and a Coma booklet written by Michael himself.`,

Built with period-accurate bodies, necks and hardware, premium finishes and meticulously voiced, year-specific pickups, each instrument captures the essence of authentic Fender craftsmanship and tone.

            During the late '50s and early '60s, the popularity of Fender musical instruments flourished, and although the Fender assortment had expanded to include many great new instruments, the Stratocaster® reigned supreme. By 1961, the Stratocaster had taken on a more refined aesthetic, with a 3-Color Sunburst reformulated with a more vibrant red and bolder black edge, topped with a 3-ply pickguard accenting the Strat's signature curves.
            
            Featuring a premium alder body, a trio of Pure Vintage 1961 Stratocaster pickups and a medium "C"-Shaped maple neck mated with a 7.25" radius slab rosewood fingerboard, the American Vintage II 1961 Stratocaster reproduces the quintessential tone and feel of the original. Other appointments include a vintage-accurate synchronized tremolo with cold rolled steel block and bent steel saddles, single-line "Fender Deluxe" tuners and 3-ply pickguard.
            
            The instruments in the American Vintage II series are direct descendants of the original Fenders: designed for players with a fine appreciation for vintage Fender tone and feel and built with unmatched quality, down to the last screw. These are Fender electrics in their purest form: Fender American Vintage II, the stuff of legends.`,

            During the late '50s and early '60s, the popularity of Fender musical instruments flourished, and although the Fender assortment had expanded to include many great new instruments, the Stratocaster® reigned supreme. By 1961, the Stratocaster had taken on a more refined aesthetic, with a 3-Color Sunburst reformulated with a more vibrant red and bolder black edge, topped with a 3-ply pickguard accenting the Strat's signature curves.

Other appointments include a vintage-accurate synchronized tremolo with cold rolled steel block and bent steel saddles, single-line "Fender Deluxe" tuners and 3-ply pickguard.
            
            The instruments in the American Vintage II series are direct descendants of the original Fenders: designed for players with a fine appreciation for vintage Fender tone and feel and built with unmatched quality, down to the last screw. These are Fender electrics in their purest form: Fender American Vintage II, the stuff of legends.`,

Intended to provide a luxury playing experience and tempt jazz guitarists into playing solidbody electric guitars, this futuristic and comfort-contoured offset is about as far from a boxy archtop as can be imagined.

          Johnny Marr is best known as the strikingly dynamic guitarist-arranger-songwriter behind the Smiths, who redefined and ruled U.K. pop in the 1980s. A master of melody, layering and texture, Marr has brought his own instantly identifiable genius to the proceedings ever since, in stints with The The, the Pretenders, Modest Mouse and the Cribs - to say nothing of his solo career and innumerable guest appearances. The Johnny Marr Jaguar® is a fantastically non-standard model that is as distinctive as the sounds he wrings from it.`,

          For players who appreciate the mojo of Fender's golden era matched to contemporary features, we created the Vintera® '60s Jaguar® Modified. Blending classic looks with a modern neck profile and fingerboard radius, hotter pickups and updated electronics - this guitar packs a surprising amount of power under the hood.
          
          To crank out giant-sized tone from this short-scale wonder, we loaded it up with a pair of high-output Atomic™ humbucking pickups. They have the power to easily drive a tube amp into luscious overdrive, while retaining the articulate sound that made Fender famous. The "Modern C"-shaped neck has a 9.5"-radius maple fingerboard with 22 medium-jumbo frets, for modern playing feel. An Adjusto-matic™ bridge is paired to Jaguar floating tremolo, while vintage-style tuning machines provide original-era aesthetics, rock-solid performance and tuning stability. Joining the master volume and tone controls, two sliders on the lower bout activate/deactivate each pickup while the third slider activates a "tone cut". The wheels on the upper horn select between single-coil and humbucking modes for each pickup, giving you more tonal variety. Other features include a kill switch mounted on the upper horn, chrome hardware and four-bolt neck plate. Includes a deluxe gig bag.`,

Kurt Cobain and his bandmates in Nirvana appeared on the scene in the early '90s as generational talents who combined raucous, heavy tones, punk-infused energy and melodic hooks to create a sound that quickly attracted millions of fans and established grunge and alternative rock as a genre with legitimate mainstream appeal.

          Although Kurt was seen playing a variety of Fender guitars over the years, his Fender Jaguar® and Mustang® remain the most iconic due to their use on the "Nevermind" tour and "Smells Like Teen Spirit" music video. Kurt designed the Jag-Stang® to combine his favorite elements of both instruments and brought it to life with help from the Fender Custom Shop in 1993.

The vintage-style single-coil and custom humbucking pickups are perfect for recreating Kurt's classic tones, while the Mustang slider switches provide the flexibility to dial in four distinct settings for a variety of in or out-of-phase tones.`,
